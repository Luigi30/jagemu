/* The Jaguar object processor.
 *
 * See the Software Reference manual (chapter 3 of the Jaguar developer manuals)
 * for details on the objects and their structures.
 *
 * The object processor's job is to traverse a linked list of graphics objects,
 * determine which ones are to be drawn on this scanline, and draw them to the
 * line buffer if required.
 *
 * The object processor deals in terms of 64-bit phrases.
 *
 * There are five types of objects:
 * - 0: BITMAP - 2 phrases - aligned on a 2-phrase boundary.
 *      Display a bitmap object.
 *
 * - 1: SCALE  - 3 phrases - aligned on a 4-phrase boundary.
 *      Display a scaled bitmap object.
 *
 * - 2: GPU    - 1 phrase  - aligned on a 1-phrase boundary
 *      Triggers a GPU interrupt.
 *
 * - 3: BRANCH - 1 phrase  - aligned on a 1-phrase boundary
 *      Causes the object processor to branch to another point in the list
 *      if a condition code is true.
 *
 * - 4: STOP   - 1 phrase  - aligned on a 1-phrase boundary
 *      Terminates the object list and stops the object processor immediately.
 *      Optionally interrupts the CPU.
